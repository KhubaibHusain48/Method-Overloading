### **Project Title**

**Polymorphism in Java â€“ Method and Constructor Overloading**

---

### **Description**

This Java project demonstrates **compile-time polymorphism** using method and constructor overloading. It includes two overloaded `add` methods and two overloaded constructors to illustrate how Java resolves method calls based on parameter types and counts.

---

### **Features**

* Method overloading with two `add` methods:

  * `add(int a, int b)`
  * `add(int a, int b, int c)`
* Constructor overloading with:

  * A default constructor
  * A parameterized constructor
* Prints the results of overloaded methods to the console.

---

### **How to Run the Code**

1. Save the code in a file named `Overloading.java` under the folder structure `ConceptsCode/Polymorphism/`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   javac ConceptsCode/Polymorphism/Overloading.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   java ConceptsCode.Polymorphism.Overloading
   ```

---

### **Prerequisites**

* Java JDK installed (version 8 or above)
* Basic knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts
* A text editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Eclipse)

---

### **Sample Output**

```
Inside Constructor
Sum is: 3
Now Sum Is: 12
```
